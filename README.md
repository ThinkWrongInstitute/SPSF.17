# Learning to Learn

Education is what is remained after you have forgotten what you learned in school. We believe that there is a more effective and fun way to embark onto the journey of life-long learning and prepare ourselves for the unpredictable future. This would be an opportunity for us and for you to experience different aspects of the world while creating an influential and exciting project to execute together.
